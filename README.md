# EvoXT Cloud VPS Hosting: Lightning-Fast Performance, Global Coverage, Budget-Friendly Pricing

You know that feeling when you're scrolling through VPS provider after VPS provider, and they all start to look the same? Same tired marketing speak, same vague promises about "enterprise-grade infrastructure," same pricing that somehow balloons once you actually read the fine print. Well, here's the thing about EvoXT that caught my attention—they're not trying to be all things to all people. They're just ridiculously focused on one thing: squeezing every last drop of performance out of high-frequency CPUs and selling it to you at prices that make you double-check the decimal point.

I've spent the last few weeks poking around their service, and honestly, it's one of those rare cases where a company actually delivers on what sounds like marketing hype. Industry-leading single-core CPU performance up to 6.0 GHz? Yeah, that's real. Starting at $2.99 per month? Also real. Automatic weekly backups included at zero extra cost? You get the picture.

Let's dig into what makes EvoXT worth your time, and more importantly, your money.

## **What Actually Is EvoXT?**

EvoXT is a cloud VPS provider that's been quietly building a reputation in the hosting community for doing something most competitors don't: prioritizing CPU clock speed over core count. While everyone else is racing to cram more cores into their offerings, EvoXT looked at actual workload patterns and realized that for most applications, especially web hosting, databases, and development environments, high single-threaded performance beats multiple slower cores every single time.

Their virtual machines run on processors clocked up to 6.0 GHz, which absolutely smokes the industry average. To put this in perspective, when EvoXT compared their baseline performance against major competitors back in 2020, they were running at 6.0 GHz while most others were puttering along at 2.2-2.4 GHz. That's not a small difference—that's the kind of gap that changes how your applications actually feel to use.

The company operates across 16 global data centers spanning the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. They're particularly strong in Asia, with optimized routing to China via CN2 network and direct peering with major regional ISPs. If you're serving Asian markets, this matters more than you might think.

## **The Pricing That Makes You Wonder If There's a Catch**

There isn't a catch, by the way. I looked. Here's what EvoXT's standard pricing looks like across their primary regions (United States, UK, Canada, Germany, Poland, Netherlands, Japan Tokyo, Malaysia, and Australia):

| Plan | CPU Cores | RAM | Storage (SSD) | Monthly Transfer | Backup | Monthly Price |
|------|-----------|-----|---------------|------------------|--------|---------------|
| VM-0.5 | 1 core (Up to 6.0 GHz) | 512 MB | 5 GB | 500 GB | Weekly | $2.99 |
| VM-0.75 | 1 core (Up to 6.0 GHz) | 1 GB | 10 GB | 750 GB | Weekly | $4.99 |
| VM-1 | 1 core (Up to 6.0 GHz) | 2 GB | 20 GB | 1,000 GB | Weekly | $5.99 |
| VM-1.5 | 2 cores (Up to 6.0 GHz) | 2 GB | 20 GB | 1,500 GB | Weekly | $6.95 |
| VM-2 | 2 cores (Up to 6.0 GHz) | 4 GB | 30 GB | 2,000 GB | Weekly | $11.99 |
| VM-3 | 4 cores (Up to 6.0 GHz) | 4 GB | 30 GB | 3,000 GB | Weekly | $14.99 |
| VM-4 | 4 cores (Up to 6.0 GHz) | 8 GB | 60 GB | 4,000 GB | Weekly | $23.99 |
| VM-6 | 8 cores (Up to 6.0 GHz) | 8 GB | 60 GB | 5,000 GB | Weekly | $29.99 |
| VM-8 | 8 cores (Up to 6.0 GHz) | 16 GB | 80 GB | 6,000 GB | Weekly | $47.99 |
| VM-12 | 16 cores (Up to 6.0 GHz) | 16 GB | 80 GB | 8,000 GB | Weekly | $60.95 |
| VM-16 | 16 cores (Up to 6.0 GHz) | 32 GB | 100 GB | 10 TB | Weekly | $95.99 |

For their premium network regions (Hong Kong, Japan Osaka, and Malaysia Premium), the pricing remains identical, but bandwidth allocations are adjusted to reflect higher network costs in those areas. The trade-off is worth it if you're targeting Asian audiences—the routing quality and latency improvements are substantial.

What's genuinely refreshing here is the transparency. That $2.99 plan costs $2.99. They don't hit you with bandwidth overage fees. They don't charge extra for IPv6. They don't sneak in CPU burst charges. The weekly automatic backups that most providers would monetize separately? Included. That's the actual price.

## **Windows VPS Without the Windows Tax**

Here's something that'll make Windows users sit up straight: EvoXT offers Windows VPS with Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access at zero additional licensing cost. If you've ever priced out Windows VPS elsewhere, you know the licensing fees typically add $10-20 per month to your bill. EvoXT eats that cost.

You can deploy Windows Server on any of their plans at the same pricing as Linux VPS. The performance characteristics remain identical—same blazing CPU speeds, same storage, same bandwidth. Whether you need Windows for ASP.NET development, running Windows-specific applications, or just prefer the Windows server environment, you're not paying a premium for the privilege.

## **40% Recurring Discount with Promo Code EVOXT595**

Now here's where things get interesting. EvoXT currently offers a recurring 40% discount through promo code EVOXT595, applicable to VM-1 plans and above. This isn't a first-month gimmick that expires—it's a recurring discount that applies as long as you maintain your service.

Let's run the numbers on what this actually means. Take the VM-4 plan at $23.99 per month—that's already competitive pricing for 4 cores at 6.0 GHz, 8GB RAM, and 60GB storage. With the EVOXT595 code, you're looking at:

$$\text{Discounted Price} = \$23.99 \times (1 - 0.40) = \$23.99 \times 0.60 = \$14.39$$

So you're getting that VM-4 configuration for $14.39 per month, every month. Over a year, that discount saves you:

$$\text{Annual Savings} = (\$23.99 - \$14.39) \times 12 = \$9.60 \times 12 = \$115.20$$

The code applies across all their standard plans from VM-1 upward, which means your savings scale with your infrastructure needs. If you're running multiple instances or larger configurations, those savings compound quickly.

## **Global Data Center Coverage That Actually Matters**

EvoXT operates 16 data center locations strategically positioned across major global regions. But what matters isn't just the number of locations—it's the network quality and peering arrangements behind them. Here's where EvoXT distinguishes itself:

**North America**: Their US locations connect to NYIX (New York Internet Exchange) and multiple Tier 1 ISPs. The Montreal facility peers with QIX Montreal and several Tier 1 providers. These aren't budget transit connections—they're direct peerings with the backbone of internet infrastructure.

**Europe**: London location connects to LINX, France location to France-IX, Amsterdam to AMS-IX, ERA-IX, and NL-IX, Germany to DE-CIX, and Switzerland to SwissIX. Each connection involves multiple Tier 1 providers, ensuring redundant paths and consistent low latency across European traffic patterns.

**Asia-Pacific**: This is where EvoXT's network investment really shows. The Hong Kong location optimizes routing to China via CN2 network, which is the premium route for Chinese internet traffic. Malaysia connects to MyIX with local ISP peering plus Google and Cloudflare. Indonesia peers with JKT-IX. Japan Tokyo connects to BBIX and JPIX with Softbank transit. Japan Osaka connects to BBIX. Korea connects to KINX with Korea Telecom transit. Singapore peers through BBIX. Australia maintains peering with major Australian exchanges.

That level of interconnection detail matters because it directly impacts your application latency and reliability. When EvoXT says they provide "low latency to Asia," they're not hand-waving—they've built the actual network infrastructure to deliver it.

## **The Control Panel That Doesn't Get in Your Way**

EvoXT's custom control panel takes about three minutes to figure out, which is exactly how long control panels should take to figure out. No multi-day tutorial required, no endless nested menus to hunt through. The dashboard shows you what you need: server status, performance metrics, resource utilization.

The interface gives you one-click access to essential operations like server power controls, VNC console access, firewall configuration, IP address management, and backup restoration. Everything loads quickly, nothing feels sluggish, and the VNC implementation is particularly smooth for those inevitable moments when you need direct console access.

Their IP address management tool deserves special mention. You can swap IP addresses between servers, reassign floating IPs, and order additional IP addresses ($3/month per address) directly through the interface. This makes failover configurations and server migrations significantly less painful than typical VPS management workflows.

The firewall system operates at Layer 3, which means you can configure rules without even connecting to your virtual machine. Set up your security policies before your server goes live, modify them on the fly, and test configurations without SSH access. It's enterprise-grade network security with consumer-grade usability.

## **Dedicated Servers for When VPS Isn't Enough**

When you outgrow shared virtualization infrastructure, EvoXT offers dedicated servers with full hardware access. These aren't rebranded reseller boxes—they're custom-built configurations with modern AMD Ryzen and Intel processors.

Here's their current dedicated server lineup:

**AMD Options:**

| Processor | Cores/Frequency | RAM | Storage | Bandwidth | Monthly Price |
|-----------|-----------------|-----|---------|-----------|---------------|
| AMD 7800X3D | 8 cores, up to 5.0 GHz | 32GB DDR5 ECC | 2x U.2 NVMe 0.96TB | 1 Gbps, 20TB | $219 |
| AMD 7900X3D | 12 cores, up to 5.6 GHz | 64GB DDR5 ECC | 2x U.2 NVMe 1.92TB | 1 Gbps, 20TB | $249 |
| AMD 7950X3D | 16 cores, up to 5.7 GHz | 128GB DDR5 ECC | 2x U.2 NVMe 3.84TB | 1 Gbps, 20TB | $279 |

**Intel Options:**

| Processor | Cores/Frequency | RAM | Storage | Bandwidth | Monthly Price |
|-----------|-----------------|-----|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Intel i5-13600K | 14 cores, up to 5.3 GHz | 32GB DDR5 ECC | 2x U.2 NVMe 0.96TB | 1 Gbps, 20TB | $259 |
| Intel i7-13700K | 16 cores, up to 5.4 GHz | 64GB DDR5 ECC | 2x U.2 NVMe 1.92TB | 1 Gbps, 20TB | $289 |
| Intel i9-13900K | 24 cores, up to 5.8 GHz | 128GB DDR5 ECC | 2x U.2 NVMe 3.84TB | 1 Gbps, 20TB | $329 |

👉 [Explore Dedicated Server Options](https://console.evoxt.com/aff.php?aff=1168)

All dedicated servers include VNC console access through the control panel, which means you can manage your server directly without requiring functional network access. Need to run Android emulators that require hardware virtualization passthrough? These servers support it. Want to install a custom partition scheme or obscure operating system? They'll mount the ISO for you.

Dedicated servers require a minimum one-year contract with first and last month payment upfront. Setup typically takes about three days depending on configuration complexity and customization requirements. If you need additional storage, more IP addresses, or increased bandwidth, those options are available—just open a support ticket with your specifications.

## **Features That Should Be Standard But Usually Aren't**

EvoXT includes several capabilities that competitors either charge extra for or don't offer at all:

**Automatic Weekly Offsite Backups**: Every VPS plan includes weekly backups stored offsite at zero additional cost. These aren't snapshots stored on the same physical hardware as your server—they're actual offsite backups that protect against datacenter-level failures. One-click restoration through the control panel makes recovery straightforward when you need it.

**Server Cloning**: Need to duplicate a production environment for testing? The clone function creates an exact replica of your virtual machine including all configurations and data. No manual migration process, no configuration drift, no tedious reinstallation of packages.

**Rescue Mode**: When your server won't boot because something went wrong with the filesystem or boot configuration, rescue mode lets you boot into a recovery environment to fix problems or migrate data. One click from the control panel, no support ticket required.

**API Access**: The complete EvoXT API lets you automate server provisioning, configuration, and management without touching the web interface. If you're managing infrastructure as code or building automated deployment pipelines, the API documentation covers all the operations you'd expect.

**Sub-Accounts**: Need to give different team members different levels of access? Sub-account support lets you create separate logins with granular permissions for administrators, technical teams, billing teams, and support staff. No more sharing root credentials or implementing hacky workaround permission schemes.

**Cryptocurrency Payment Options**: EvoXT accepts Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and USDT Tron in addition to traditional payment methods like credit cards and PayPal. If you prioritize payment privacy or operate in jurisdictions with limited traditional payment access, crypto support removes a significant barrier.

## **Performance Benchmarks That Tell the Real Story**

Marketing claims about performance are cheap. Benchmark data is slightly more expensive but significantly more useful. According to third-party testing from VPSBenchmarks, EvoXT's VM-1 plan produces the following results:

**CPU Performance (Sysbench)**: EvoXT's single-core performance significantly outpaces competitors in the same price range. The high clock speed advantage translates directly to faster computational performance for single-threaded workloads.

**Memory Performance**: RAM throughput and latency metrics show consistent performance across the board with DDR5 memory configurations on newer servers delivering particularly strong results.

**Disk Performance**: NVMe SSD storage delivers the kind of IOPS and throughput you'd expect from modern solid-state storage. Random read/write operations maintain consistent performance even under load.

The key insight from benchmark data is that EvoXT's focus on CPU frequency delivers real-world performance advantages for typical web hosting, database, and development workloads where single-threaded performance drives application responsiveness.

## **The Support Situation**

EvoXT provides support through live chat and ticket system. Customer reviews on Trustpilot present a mixed picture—positive reviews highlight solid server performance and responsive support, while negative reviews mention slower response times on billing issues and bandwidth upgrade activations.

The most recent positive review from December 2025 notes "Been with them for over a year now, a very nice service," indicating stable long-term performance. Earlier reviews from 2020 and 2022 also praised support responsiveness and server stability.

One critical review from May 2024 reported slow support response on bandwidth upgrade activation after purchase. This suggests that while technical support generally performs well, billing and account management processes may experience occasional delays during busy periods.

The practical takeaway: expect competent technical support for server-related issues, but set realistic expectations around response times for billing or account modification requests. For most technical problems, the comprehensive control panel features reduce support dependency significantly.

## **Scaling and Upgrade Options**

EvoXT makes scaling straightforward through their upgrade system accessible directly from the VM control panel. No support tickets required for most upgrades:

**Additional Resources:**
- Extra CPU cores: $3 per vCore monthly
- Extra RAM: $2 per GB monthly  
- Additional bandwidth: $3 per TB monthly (standard network), $12 per TB monthly (premium network)
- Additional IP addresses: $3 per IP monthly
- Paid backup plans: Pricing varies based on storage size

The flexible upgrade model means you can start small and scale incrementally as your requirements grow. The pricing structure remains transparent throughout—no surprise fees, no forced tier jumps where you pay for resources you don't need.

## **Who Should Actually Use EvoXT?**

EvoXT works particularly well for several specific use cases:

**Web Developers and Agencies**: If you're hosting client websites, staging environments, or development servers, the combination of fast single-threaded performance and budget-friendly pricing makes EvoXT an obvious choice. The VM-1 plan at $5.99 (or $3.59 with the EVOXT595 code) handles typical WordPress, Laravel, or Node.js applications with ease.

**Asian Market Focus**: Companies serving customers in Asia benefit significantly from EvoXT's network infrastructure investments in the region. The CN2 routing to China, direct ISP peering across APAC markets, and multiple regional data center options deliver measurably better performance than routing Asian traffic through US or European servers.

**Budget-Conscious Operations**: When you need legitimate performance but can't justify enterprise pricing, EvoXT fills that gap. The baseline performance exceeds what you'd typically get from comparably priced alternatives, and the included features eliminate most upsell opportunities.

**Windows-Specific Workloads**: If you require Windows Server environments, EvoXT's zero-cost Windows licensing makes them extremely cost-competitive. Running multiple Windows VPS instances elsewhere quickly becomes expensive—EvoXT's flat pricing model changes that calculation entirely.

**High-Frequency Trading Bots and Applications**: Applications that benefit from high single-threaded CPU performance rather than many slower cores perform exceptionally well on EvoXT infrastructure. Trading bots, real-time data processing, and similar latency-sensitive applications see tangible benefits from the 6.0 GHz clock speeds.

## **What EvoXT Isn't Good For**

Fair is fair—EvoXT isn't optimal for every use case:

**Enterprise SLA Requirements**: If you need guaranteed 99.99% uptime with financial penalties for breaches, contractual SLAs, and 24/7 premium phone support, you want AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. EvoXT targets the performance-per-dollar market, not the compliance-and-contracts market.

**Massive Parallel Processing**: Workloads that genuinely benefit from dozens or hundreds of CPU cores running in parallel aren't EvoXT's strength. Their focus on clock speed over core count means applications optimized for massive parallelization might perform better elsewhere.

**DDoS-Heavy Environments**: EvoXT doesn't advertise built-in DDoS protection as a standard feature. If you're running services that attract frequent large-scale DDoS attacks, you'll want additional protection layers beyond what's included.

## **The Bottom Line Worth Your Time**

EvoXT does one thing exceptionally well: they deliver high-performance VPS hosting at prices that make sense for small to medium businesses, developers, and agencies who need actual performance without enterprise budgets. The 6.0 GHz CPU configurations aren't marketing fiction—they're the actual hardware foundation that translates into faster application performance.

The pricing transparency is refreshing in an industry that loves hidden fees and surprise charges. When you order a $5.99 plan, you pay $5.99. Add the EVOXT595 promo code for 40% recurring discount, and you're looking at performance-per-dollar ratios that are genuinely difficult to beat.

The global data center coverage with quality network peering means your applications perform well regardless of where your users are located. The Asian network infrastructure is particularly noteworthy if you serve that market—most budget providers route Asian traffic through suboptimal paths that add latency and reduce reliability.

Is EvoXT perfect? No. Support response times can be slower than ideal during peak periods, and they don't offer the comprehensive ecosystem of managed services you'd get from major cloud providers. But for straightforward VPS hosting where you want fast servers, transparent pricing, and the flexibility to scale as needed, EvoXT delivers exactly what they promise.

👉 [Start with EvoXT Today](https://console.evoxt.com/aff.php?aff=1168)

The real test of any hosting provider isn't what they promise in marketing materials—it's whether their service delivers day-to-day reliability and performance when you're actually running production workloads. Based on customer reviews spanning multiple years and third-party benchmark data, EvoXT passes that test consistently. They're not trying to revolutionize cloud computing or promise magical performance gains. They're just running high-frequency hardware, charging reasonable prices, and letting the performance speak for itself.

If you're tired of paying premium prices for mediocre VPS performance, or you've been burned by providers who promise the world and deliver significantly less, EvoXT represents a pragmatic alternative worth serious consideration. Give the VM-1 plan a try with the EVOXT595 discount code—at under $4 monthly, the downside risk is minimal and the potential upside is a hosting provider that actually works as advertised.
